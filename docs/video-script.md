## 🎬 **INTRO SEQUENCE** (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Animated logo with NaturaCode branding]**

**Narrator (enthusiastic, warm):** "What if I told you that you could program a computer using nothing but plain English? No curly braces, no semicolons, no cryptic syntax - just natural human language."

**[Screen: Split view - traditional code vs NaturaCode]**

**Traditional Code:**
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if(i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(`Even: ${i}`);
    }
}
```

**NaturaCode:**
```naturacode
repeat 10 times
    if counter is equal to even number, show "Even:" followed by counter
end
```

**Narrator:** "Today, I'll show you NaturaCode - a revolutionary programming language that bridges the gap between human thought and computer execution."

## 🚀 **SECTION 1: WHAT IS NATURACODE?** (0:30 - 2:00)

**[Screen: Clean animation explaining the concept]**

**Narrator:** "NaturaCode is a programming language designed to feel as natural as having a conversation. Instead of memorizing complex syntax, you simply tell the computer what you want in plain English."

**[Screen: Examples sliding in]**

**Narrator:** "Want to create a variable? Just say 'create a number called age with value 25'. Need to do math? Simply 'add 5 to age'. Want to make decisions? 'if age is above 18, show welcome message'."

**[Screen: Benefits list with icons]**

**Key Benefits:**
- 🗣️ **Natural English Syntax** - Write code like you speak
- 🎯 **Perfect for Beginners** - No syntax to memorize
- 🤖 **AI-Friendly** - Works seamlessly with AI assistants

## 🌐 **SECTION 3: WEB INTERFACE TOUR** (4:00 - 6:30)

**[Screen: Web browser showing NaturaCode interface]**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to the NaturaCode web editor! This beautiful interface was designed to make coding feel approachable and fun."

**[Screen: Highlighting different sections]**

**Interface Tour:**
- **Left Panel:** Code editor with natural syntax highlighting
- **Right Panel:** Real-time output and results
- **Bottom Panel:** Current program state (variables, tasks)
- **Top Bar:** Action buttons and examples

**Narrator:** "The interface comes pre-loaded with examples. Let's click 'Variables & Math' to see NaturaCode in action."

**[Screen: Loading the Variables example]**

**Example Code:**
```naturacode
create a number called x with value 10
add 5 to x
multiply x by 2
show x

create a string called greeting with value "Hello World"
show greeting
```

**Narrator:** "Look how readable this is! Even someone who's never programmed before can understand exactly what's happening."

**[Screen: Clicking "Run Code" button]**

**Narrator:** "When we click 'Run Code', watch the magic happen in real-time..."

**[Screen: Output panel showing results]**

**Output:**
```
Created number x with value 10
Added 5 to x. New value: 15
Multiplied x by 2. New value: 30
x: 30
Created string greeting with value "Hello World"
greeting: Hello World
```

**Narrator:** "Notice how the output reads like a conversation! NaturaCode doesn't just execute your code - it explains what it's doing in plain English."

---

## 🎯 **SECTION 4: CORE FEATURES WALKTHROUGH** (6:30 - 11:00)

### **Variables and Math** (6:30 - 7:30)

**[Screen: Clean code editor]**

**Narrator:** "Let's explore NaturaCode's core features. First, variables and arithmetic operations."

**[Screen: Typing in real-time]**

```naturacode
create a number called temperature with value 72
create a string called weather with value "sunny"

show "Today's weather is"
show weather
show "with a temperature of"
show temperature
show "degrees"
```

**Narrator:** "Variables in NaturaCode are crystal clear. You specify the type - number or string - give it a name, and set its value. No mysterious symbols or declarations needed."

**[Screen: Adding arithmetic]**

```naturacode
add 10 to temperature
show "After adding 10 degrees:"
show temperature

if temperature is above 75, show "It's getting warm!" otherwise show "Perfect temperature!"
```

**[Screen: Running and showing output]**

**Narrator:** "Arithmetic is just as natural. 'Add 10 to temperature', 'subtract 5 from score', 'multiply price by tax rate' - it reads exactly like you'd explain it to a friend."

### **Conditionals and Logic** (7:30 - 8:30)

**[Screen: New example]**

**Narrator:** "Decision-making in programming has never been clearer. Let's look at conditionals."

```naturacode
create a number called score with value 85

if score is above 90, show "Excellent work!"
if score is above 80, show "Great job!" otherwise show "Keep practicing!"
if score is below 60, show "Need more study time"
```

**Narrator:** "No complex boolean operators, no parentheses to remember. Just natural English comparisons: 'is above', 'is below', 'is equal to'."

### **Loops and Repetition** (8:30 - 9:30)

**[Screen: Loop examples]**

**Narrator:** "Loops in NaturaCode are beautifully simple."

```naturacode
create a number called countdown with value 5

repeat 5 times
    show "Countdown:"
    show countdown
    subtract 1 from countdown
end

show "Blast off!"
```

**Narrator:** "Just say 'repeat 5 times' and end with 'end'. You can also use while loops: 'while count is below 10' - it's that natural."

### **Task Management** (9:30 - 10:30)

**[Screen: Task examples]**

**Narrator:** "One of NaturaCode's unique features is built-in task management. Perfect for organizing your thoughts or building productivity apps."

```naturacode
create a task called "Learn NaturaCode" with status "pending"
create a task called "Build an app" with status "pending"
create a task called "Share with friends" with status "complete"

show all tasks

mark task "Learn NaturaCode" as complete
show tasks where status is "complete"
```

**Narrator:** "You can create tasks, mark them complete, and filter them - all in plain English. This makes NaturaCode perfect for rapid prototyping of task management applications."

### **API Integration** (10:30 - 11:00)

**[Screen: API example]**

**Narrator:** "NaturaCode even handles API calls naturally."

```naturacode
connect to the API at "https://api.example.com/search"
send a search for "programming tips" using the key "query"
get the response
show the response
```

**Narrator:** "No complex HTTP libraries or callback functions. Just connect, send your search, get the response, and show it. The language handles all the technical details behind the scenes."

---

## 🎤 **SECTION 5: SPEECH-TO-CODE FEATURE** (11:00 - 12:30)

**[Screen: Web interface highlighting "To Speech" button]**

**Narrator:** "Here's where NaturaCode gets truly revolutionary - perfect speech-to-code fidelity."

**[Screen: Running a program first]**

```naturacode
create a number called magic with value 42
create a task called "Find the answer" with status "complete"
show "The answer to everything is:"
show magic
```

**[Screen: Clicking "To Speech" button]**

**Narrator:** "When we click 'To Speech', NaturaCode converts our program state into natural language..."

**Speech Output:**
"Create a number called magic with value 42. Create a task called 'Find the answer' with status 'complete'."

**Narrator:** "But here's the amazing part - this speech can be converted back to working code with zero information loss. This enables voice programming, accessibility features, and seamless collaboration between humans and AI."

**[Screen: Demonstrating speech-to-code conversion]**

**Narrator:** "Imagine dictating code while driving, or having an AI assistant understand and modify your programs through natural conversation. That's the future NaturaCode enables."

---

## 🤖 **SECTION 6: AI INTEGRATION** (12:30 - 13:30)

**[Screen: AI/LLM example]**

**Narrator:** "NaturaCode was designed for the AI age. Watch how naturally it integrates with large language models."

```naturacode
connect to MCP server at "claude://localhost:3001" with protocol "mcp"
send message to model "claude-3-sonnet" with user message "Explain recursion simply"
wait for model response
get the response as "explanation"
show explanation
```

**Narrator:** "You can literally have conversations with AI models as part of your code. Ask for help, get explanations, or even have the AI write portions of your program."

**[Screen: Showing mock AI response]**

**Output:**
```
Connected to MCP server at claude://localhost:3001 using mcp protocol
Sending message to claude-3-sonnet...
✅ Received response from LLM
Stored LLM response in variable "explanation"
explanation: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of a problem...
```

**Narrator:** "This creates entirely new workflows where humans, AI, and code all collaborate in the same natural language."

## 🚀 **SECTION 7: BUILDING A COMPLETE APPLICATION** (13:30 - 14:30)

**[Screen: Starting fresh example]**

**Narrator:** "Let's build a complete mini-application to see NaturaCode's power. We'll create a simple personal assistant."

```naturacode
note: Personal Assistant App

create a string called name with value "Alex"
create a number called energy with value 100
create a number called tasks_completed with value 0

show "Hello! I'm your assistant"
show name

create a task called "Check emails" with status "pending"
create a task called "Schedule meeting" with status "pending"
create a task called "Prepare presentation" with status "complete"

show "Here are your current tasks:"
show all tasks

note: Simulate completing a task
mark task "Check emails" as complete
add 1 to tasks_completed
subtract 10 from energy

show "Task completed! Energy remaining:"
show energy

if energy is below 50, show "Time for a break!" otherwise show "Ready for more tasks!"

show "Tasks completed today:"
show tasks_completed

if tasks_completed is above 0, show "Great productivity today!"
```

**[Screen: Running the complete application]**

**Narrator:** "In just a few lines of readable English, we've created a functional personal assistant that manages tasks, tracks energy, and provides feedback. The code is so clear that anyone can understand and modify it."
